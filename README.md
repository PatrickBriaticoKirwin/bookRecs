This is a simple Go service to fetch the book recommendations from a db I created. 
More info on how the recommendations were collected are found on my page.
I'm writing this first so I don't know what exists when you see this but I think I'm going to put the scripts Chat GPT made for me here too.
There should also be a form here to add more recommendations, as the people I have so far are still alive and suggesting books for me to purchase and never read (I never learned how)
